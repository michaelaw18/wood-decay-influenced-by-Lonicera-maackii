This is the repository for data and code from the publication X. 

We conducted an experiment in which we tested the impacts of the invasive shrub, _Lonicera maackii _ (Amur honeysuckle) on the decomposition of _Quercus rubra_ and _Pinus radiata_ wood in a temperate deciduous forest in Southwestern Ohio, USA. We placed wood blocks in the forest in April 2017 and measured the presence/absence, abundance, and size of _L. maackii_ within on meter of the blocks, as well as canopy cover over the blocks. We allowed wood to decay for one year, and measured wood moisture, enzyme activities, and the presence of insects on the wood blocks. We compared pre and post decomposition weights to calculate decay rates of the wood blocks as well. After two years of decay, we collected a second set of blocks and measured insect presence, moisture and decay rates. This data was collected and curated during this experiment, and code presented is the analysis corresponding with the manuscript.
